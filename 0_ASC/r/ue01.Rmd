## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars, echo=TRUE)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist, ylab="distance", xlab="speed")
```

Cars average (mean) speed: `r mean(cars$speed)`

```{r overview, echo=F}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```
